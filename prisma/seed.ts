What you're reading right now is called a "task" in Basecamp. Basecamp tasks are essentially just a fancy todo list, much like a grocery list. This helps us organize information we will need from you.`,

So, when you have questions there are a few options to get help:
              
1. Add a comment and tag us. Basecamp has a way to tag/mention other people on the project, much like any social media platform. Here's how you can tag us for help.
2. Ping us. Alternatively, Basecamp also gives you the ability to ping our team members on your project. This works like a private message (or direct message if you prefer that term). Here's how to ping us for help.`,

How you choose to work through the tasks are 100% up to you. We do not pressure you to complete this as fast as possible.

If you want to burst through - go for it. If you want to go slow, take a break for personal reasons, and come back when you can focus again - go for it.

This is a "go your own pace" sort of process.`,
